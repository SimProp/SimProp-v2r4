How to install and run SimProp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  1) make sure that ROOT is installed and set up properly! 
     $ROOTSYS/bin and $ROOTSYS/lib have to be respectively in 
     your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Mac OS)
     For detailed info how to get, install and set up ROOT see: 
     http://root.cern.ch/drupal/

  2) type "make" to compile the software
    
  3) Add the installation directory to your PATH.
     For example in bash:
     export PATH=${PATH}:/home/jhendrix/SimProp/
     
  4) Run SimProp!
     program options can be obtained by typing "SimProp -h"
     Note: the standard output can be *very* verbose, so we recommend doing
       SimProp [options] | grep Event
     when requesting large numbers of events.

  5) The utility program Convert is also generated. This program
     convert a SimProp output from ROOT format to an ASCII file.
     (It only works with the "nucl" tree, which is only generated when
     the "-o 1" switch is not used.)
